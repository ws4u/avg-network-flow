Implementation of average network flow with networkx.

Average Network Flow (ANF) is defined as the average of the maximum network flows among all pairs of nodes in a network. It's proposed as a network robustness metric in our paper "Measuring Network Robustness by Average Network Flow". The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00877.

This repository contains the implementation of ANF and some other robustness metrics compared in the paper using NetworkX (https://networkx.org/).
